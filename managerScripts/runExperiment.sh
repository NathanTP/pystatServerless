# Runs a default seasonalOcurence.py experiment.
# Usage: ./runExperiment.sh [--cffs] [ARGS]
#
# By default will use $CFFS_PROJ_MNT/dockerSandbox that is assumed to be a real
# (non-cffs) directory. You can optionally pass --cffs which will use
# $CFFS_PROJ_MNT/cffs/cffsSandbox which should be an empty directory. Running with cffs
# requires a working cffs txn server running. The local cffs daemon (cffssvc)
# will be launched and not killed after execution (to allow manual inspection
# after).
#
# You may optionally provide arguments to be passed to seasonalOccurence.py,
# these must come after the --cffs argument (if present).

# Set up the local container, note that this script should be idempotent and
# fast to rerun
